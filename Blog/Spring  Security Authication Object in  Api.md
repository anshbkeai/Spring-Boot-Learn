# **Spring Security Authentication Object in API**  

### Overview  
When calling an API with JWT authentication, one common approach is to use the authentication object instead of retrieving the user ID from the token. The authentication object is stored in the `SecurityContextHolder`, which allows us to fetch user details securely.  

From the `SecurityContextHolder`, we obtain the authentication object, and from it, we can retrieve the principal to proceed further.  

### **Concurrency Concerns**  
One major concern is concurrency when handling authentication in a multi-user environment. Consider the following scenario:  

- User A generates a valid JWT token and makes a request to an API, where we fetch user details from the authentication object.  
- Simultaneously, User B makes a request to the same API.  
- Is there a possibility that due to parallel execution, User B's authentication object replaces User A's in the `SecurityContextHolder`?  
- If that happens, could the API return incorrect user data by mistakenly using User B’s authentication instead of User A’s?  

### **Things Learned**  

1. **Thread-Local Storage in Spring Security**  
   - `SecurityContextHolder` stores authentication in a **thread-local storage**.  
   - Each request runs in its **own thread** and has its **own authentication object**.  
   - Even if **multiple users request the API simultaneously**, their authentication objects remain **isolated** in their respective threads.  

2. **How `SecurityContextHolder` Works**  
   - Uses **thread-local storage**, meaning:  
     - Each HTTP request has its **own execution thread**.  
     - The authentication object is stored **per-thread** and **not shared globally**.  
     - Even if **100+ users** request the API at the same time, each one has its **own authentication context**.

### **When Can Errors Happen?**  

1. **Using a Shared Global Authentication Object**  
   - If authentication is stored in a **global static field** instead of `SecurityContextHolder`, it can cause data leakage.  
   - Improper **caching strategies** can also result in shared authentication objects across users. *(Needs further investigation.)*  

2. **JWT Token Misuse (Token Theft, Improper Storage)**  
   - If **User A steals User B’s token** (via **XSS, MITM attack, or exposed token**), they can impersonate User B and access their data.  

3. **Incorrect User Lookup Logic**  
   - Example: If the API fetches the user ID from a **request parameter** (`?userId=...`) instead of `SecurityContextHolder`, a **malicious user could modify the request** and access another user's data.  
   - **Never trust client-side user IDs. Always use the authentication object from the security context.**

### **Example Code Snippet**  

```java
@PostMapping("/token")
public ResponseEntity<String> generateToken() {
    // Retrieve the authentication object from SecurityContextHolder
    Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
    
    if (authentication instanceof User) {
        // Process authentication if it's a valid User object
    }
    
    // Get the authenticated user's name (typically their username)
    String userId = authentication.getName();
    
    // Log user authentication details
    log.info(authentication.getName());
    log.info(userId.getClass().getName());
    
    // Generate JWT token for the authenticated user
    String token = organisationServiceImplementation.generateToken(userId);
    
    return new ResponseEntity<>(token, HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

### **Additional Security Best Practices**  
**Use HTTP-only & Secure Cookies for storing JWTs** to prevent XSS attacks.  
 **Implement token expiration & refresh mechanisms** to enhance security.  
**Use strong encryption & hashing for stored credentials** (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).  
 **Ensure proper validation of user authentication before processing requests.**  
**Monitor & log authentication failures to detect suspicious activities.**
