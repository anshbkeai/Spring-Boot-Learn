Possibly, we won't open up about the API key
And building about the API important aspect because we don't have a public API and only the person
Developers to call it so it is easy for them to provide an API to give them an access to about we don't
The main advantage comes about as we don't have to think about like going about the complex authentication flow that we defined for the CWT as well as systems who or system so for that we are just simply
Stick to this parameter
Shift on the key is used by stripe as well as Treo TREWLO so that is a good approach active for it to do so so we are not as bad as but we should be using this as an important
I learn about like in my system, which I am creating. Now I need an API that expose my API that it should be handled by the organization only.
Preferably is about like it's only for the organization not for the individual us to handle about it like a particular individual so that's mean about it

Not designing about the API we are to is about as as we develop the application. We are gonna add things that we are going to develop.
