1.HyperMedia Driven  Api : 
Spring  Data  REST  (Have not  Worked  with  that  yet 

### **🚀 Deep Dive into Spring Data REST**  

Spring Data REST is a **framework** that **automatically exposes** Spring Data JPA repositories as RESTful APIs **without writing controllers**.  

📌 **Think of it as an auto-API generator** for your database! 🛠️  

---

## **⚡ Why Was Spring Data REST Created?**  
Before this, **every developer had to manually create CRUD APIs** like this:  

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
class ProductController {
    @Autowired private ProductRepository productRepository;
    
    @GetMapping public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        return productRepository.findAll();
    }

    @PostMapping public Product createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        return productRepository.save(product);
    }
}
```

This **works well** but requires **a lot of repetitive code**.  

Spring Data REST was introduced to **remove this boilerplate** and let developers **focus on business logic instead of API plumbing**. 🚀  

---

## **🔥 How Spring Data REST Works?**
Instead of writing controllers, you just **annotate your repository**:  

```java
@RepositoryRestResource
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {}
```
This **automatically** creates APIs like:  

🔹 `GET /products` → Get all products  
🔹 `GET /products/1` → Get a product by ID  
🔹 `POST /products` → Create a product  
🔹 `PUT /products/1` → Update a product  
🔹 `DELETE /products/1` → Delete a product  

---

## **🧐 Important Features**
### ✅ **1. HATEOAS Support**  
Spring Data REST supports **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**, which means it **automatically adds links** in API responses.  

**Example Response:**  
```json
{
  "_embedded": {
    "products": [
      {
        "name": "Laptop",
        "_links": {
          "self": { "href": "http://localhost:8080/products/1" }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
📌 **Why is this useful?**  
- Frontend clients don't need to **hardcode API URLs**; they can dynamically follow links.  
- It improves **API discoverability**.  

---

### ✅ **2. Customizing Endpoints**
By default, Spring Data REST exposes **all repository methods**, but you can **control** what gets exposed.

#### **❌ Disable a method (e.g., `DELETE`)**
```java
@RepositoryRestResource
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
    @Override
    @RestResource(exported = false) // This hides DELETE
    void deleteById(Long id);
}
```

#### **🔄 Change the default endpoint path**
```java
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "items")
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {}
```
Now, the API is at `http://localhost:8080/items` instead of `/products`.  

---

### ✅ **3. Pagination & Sorting (Built-in)**
Spring Data REST supports **pagination and sorting** out of the box:  

🔹 `GET /products?page=0&size=5` → Get 5 products (first page)  
🔹 `GET /products?sort=name,desc` → Sort by name (descending)  

No extra code needed! 🤯  

---

### **🤔 When Should You Use Spring Data REST?**
✅ **Use It When:**  
✔️ You need **quick APIs for internal use**  
✔️ You’re **building an admin panel** or **dashboard**  
✔️ Your project is small, and you just need **basic CRUD**  

🚫 **Avoid It When:**  
❌ Your API needs **custom business logic**  
❌ You need **complex request validation**  
❌ Security is a priority (auto-exposure can be risky)

## **🎤 Common Interview Questions on Spring Data REST**
💡 **Q1: What is Spring Data REST, and how does it work?**  
✅ **Answer:** Spring Data REST is a framework that **automatically exposes JPA repositories as RESTful APIs**. Instead of writing controllers, you just define a repository interface.  

💡 **Q2: What is HATEOAS, and how does Spring Data REST use it?**  
✅ **Answer:** HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) means API responses include **links** to related resources, making navigation easier for clients.  

💡 **Q3: How can you disable a specific API method in Spring Data REST?**  
✅ **Answer:** Use `@RestResource(exported = false)` on the repository method to hide it.  

💡 **Q4: How do you customize the default endpoint path in Spring Data REST?**  
✅ **Answer:** Use `@RepositoryRestResource(path = "new-path")` on the repository interface.  

💡 **Q5: When should you NOT use Spring Data REST?**  
✅ **Answer:** If you need **custom business logic**, **complex security**, or **custom validation**, you should use `@RestController` instead.

## **🛠️ Final Thoughts: Is It Worth Learning?**
✔️ **Yes**, if you're working on a quick prototype or an internal tool.  
❌ **No**, if you're building a **secure, production-ready** backend.
