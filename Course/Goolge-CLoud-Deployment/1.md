**Building Scalable Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud**
Learing  abut  the   Architerhcur of  the   COde  adn here  we are  followg  the   Pub/Sub  apporac  about  the  Rest ful  servies and  to  learn about  them ,  and 
Zipkin  help us to know  more  about    the   deployment  Process   
1.  they  are  not  teaching  about  how to  code  , but  telling  about  the  Architecture  of  thatf  code  that is  Code  in  the Java  Spring  boot  Env .
2.  You'll use Spring Cloud Config to manage your application's configuration. You'll send and receive messages with Pub/Sub and Spring Integration. You'll also use Cloud SQL as a managed relational database for your Java applications, and learn how to migrate to Spanner, which is Google Cloud's globally-distributed strongly consistent database service. You'll also learn about tracing and debugging your Spring applications with Google Cloud Observability.

You first deploy and test the application in Cloud Shell, starting with this lab, where you bring the application up by running the two microservices components in separate Cloud Shell console tabs.
### 🔍 What This Teaches

1. 🧱 **Microservice Architecture**  
   Learn how multiple Spring Boot services work together, communicate using Pub/Sub, and are structured for scalability.

2. ☁️ **Cloud-Native Configuration**  
   Use **Spring Cloud Config** to manage configuration from a central server.

3. 📡 **Asynchronous Communication with Pub/Sub**  
   Learn how to send and receive messages using **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** integrated with Spring Integration.

4. 🛢️ **Database Management**  
   - Use **Cloud SQL** as a managed relational database.
   - Learn how to migrate to **Google Cloud Spanner**, a globally-distributed and strongly consistent database.

5. 🔎 **Tracing and Debugging**  
   Use **Zipkin** and **Google Cloud Observability** to trace and debug microservices during deployment.

### ✅ Things I Did

1. 🌐 **Explored Google Cloud Shell**  
   - Learned how to use the Cloud Shell interface to manage and deploy applications.

2. 🚀 **Tested and Ran Spring Boot Apps**  
   - Deployed and tested the Spring Boot application directly in Cloud Shell.

3. 👨‍💻 **Ran Both Provided and Custom Apps**  
   - Successfully ran both the lab-provided app and my own Spring Boot service side-by-side — a valuable and practical experience.

### 📚 Summary

- This learning path **doesn't teach you how to write code** from scratch, but rather focuses on understanding how everything works behind the scenes.
- It’s about understanding **how microservices are structured**, how configuration and messaging are handled in the cloud, and how to **trace, debug, and deploy** these services effectively.

***Things  Done***
**1. THE we  have  leant  aboout  the   CLoud  COonlsoe  about  seeing ot  and  leanring  about it 
  2.  We  hace  test adn  rn th e  spring boot  app  in  th e Clod  shell 
  3.  RUn  their app  alson  and  Mine  one also  that is  the  Good lpart   which  i  have  learnt**
